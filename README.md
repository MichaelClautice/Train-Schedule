This app was created to enable users to look up their train schedule

Requirements
1. create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. 
2. App will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js.
3. The website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
4. * When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    
    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes

* Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
  
* Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.

5. Use GitHub to backup your project
6. Deploy the assignment to Github Pages


Technologies Used
* jQuery for Dom Manipulation
* Firebase to store data 
* GitHub to backup your project
* GithHub Pages to host finished site.
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Moment.js 

Code Explaination

I created a variable that allowed me to calculate the times for the train scheduler.

var trainFreq;

  		// Time is to be entered on the entry form
   		 var firstTime = 0;

	   var firstTimeConverted = moment(firstTime, "HH:mm").subtract(1, "years");
	    console.log(firstTimeConverted);

	  // Current Time
	    var currentTime = moment();
	    console.log("CURRENT TIME: " + moment(currentTime).format("HH:mm"));

	  // Difference between the times
		var diffTime = moment().diff(moment(firstTimeConverted), "minutes");
		console.log("DIFFERENCE IN TIME: " + diffTime);

		// Time apart (remainder)
	    var tRemainder = diffTime % trainFreq;
	    console.log(tRemainder);

	    // Minute Until Train
	    var tMinutesTillTrain = trainFreq - tRemainder;
	    console.log("MINUTES TILL TRAIN: " + tMinutesTillTrain);

	    // Next Train
	    var nextTrain = moment().add(tMinutesTillTrain, "minutes");
	    console.log("ARRIVAL TIME: " + moment(nextTrain).format("HH:mm"));


	  // Add each train's data into the table
	  $("#train-table > tbody").append("<tr><td>" + trainName + "</td><td>" + trainDest + "</td><td>" + trainFreq + 
	   "</td><td>" + moment(nextTrain).format("HH:mm") + "</td><td>" + tMinutesTillTrain + "</td></tr>");
	});

});
